### Setup
We hope if you are working on python framework then you must have Python installed.

To check version of python run

`python --version`

Now you have to install Flask

If you are planing to this project you should setup a virtualenv, if you dont have a virtualenv run the following command:
`pip install virtualenv`

Great! Now you have to setup a virtualenv, run the comand, 
`virtualenv {{name of env}}`

After setting up the virtualenv you have to activate it with,
`.\env\Scripts\activate`

After activating virtualenv you need to install all the dependencies for all the libs used in the project

Run the command for dowloading all the dependency 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This is will download all the dependencies in your virtualenv.

Now you need just go to poershell and run 

`python {{your app name.py}}`
