Flask official Website can be found [**here**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 

This is a Flask App for a blog.

This is basic hello world application for the same.

### Setup
We hope if you are working on python framework then you must have Python installed.

To check version of python run

`python --version`

Now setup virtualenv, 
`pip install virtualenv`

Great! Now you have to setup a virtualenv, run the comand, 
`virtualenv {{name of env}}`

After setting up the virtualenv you have to activate it with,
`.\env\Scripts\activate`

After activating virtualenv you need to install all the dependencies for all the libs used in the project

Run the command for dowloading all the dependency 
For flask
`pip install flask`

For Database managment we use sqlalchemy,
`pip install flask-sqlalchemy`

For handeling the login and signout we use flask login,
`pip install flask-login`

Now you need just go to powershell and run 

`python {{your app name.py}}`
