Django Website can be found [**here**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 

This is a Django ECOM website.

This is a very Basic Hello World Project for Django Which has excellent Scalability.

### Setup
We hope if you are working on python framework then you must have Python installed.

To check version of python run

`python --version`

Now you have to install Django 

I recommend setting virtualenv for projects but if you are new you can ignore it.

For installing django run 
`pip install Django`

After the Installation of Django You are ready to create a new Project.

`django-admin startproject {{Project name}}`

You can check if the project setup is correct by `cd {{Project name}}` and then run 

`python manage.py runserver`

You can find Your Site now at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Enjoy your Django Journey. You can contact us for any doubts.
