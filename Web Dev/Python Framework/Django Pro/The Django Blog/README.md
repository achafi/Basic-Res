This is a Django CRUD blog with all the major features like search, comment and login.

This is a very Basic Hello World Project for Django Which has excellent Scalability.

### Setup
We hope if you are working on python framework then you must have Python installed.

To check version of python run

`python --version`

Now you have to install Django 

I recommend setting virtualenv for projects but if you are new you can ignore it.

For installing django run 
`pip install Django`

After the Installation of Django You are ready to create a new Project.

`django-admin startproject {{Project name}}`

You can check if the project setup is correct by `cd {{Project name}}` and then run 

`python manage.py runserver`
